# Production Cost Optimization (Fictitious) Project for QuimTech S.A.

**Objective:**

Develop a machine learning model that predicts the production cost per batch, based on production process variables, with high precision (ideally with a mean absolute percentage error - MAPE - of less than 5%). The model must allow:

* Predicting future production costs: Based on known process parameters.
* Identifying the factors that most influence cost: Assisting in decision-making to optimize the production process and reduce costs.
* Simulating scenarios: Evaluating the impact of changes in production parameters on the final cost.
